# Connect-4-Game-PY

## Project description
Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game played on a vertical grid of seven columns and six rows. The objective is to be the first to form a line of four of your colored discs (traditionally red or yellow) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns dropping one of their discs from the top into any unfilled column, causing it to fall to the lowest unoccupied row. The game requires players to anticipate and block their opponent's moves while also setting up their own winning combinations. It's a simple yet engaging game suitable for players of all ages.
