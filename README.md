# Connect-4-Game-PY

## Project description

#### Setting Up:
When you start the game, you'll see a grid of 7 columns and 6 rows. Each cell in the grid represents a potential spot for a game piece.
The game board is labeled with numbers at the bottom, representing the columns. Players will use these numbers to choose where to drop their game pieces.

#### Choosing Symbols:
At the beginning of the game, players need to decide on their symbols. Traditionally, one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". You can choose any symbols you prefer, just make sure both players agree on them.

#### Taking Turns:
Players take turns to drop their symbols onto the game board. Player X goes first.
When it's your turn, input the number of the column where you want to drop your symbol. For example, if you want to drop your symbol into the third column, type '3' and press Enter.

#### Dropping Symbols:
After choosing a column, your symbol will drop from the top of that column until it lands on the lowest empty cell in that column.

#### Objective:
The goal is to be the first to connect four of your symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The connection can be made in any direction: up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

#### Winning:
If you manage to connect four of your symbols before your opponent does, you win the game!
The game will automatically end once a player achieves a winning connection.

Keep playing, strategize, and have fun trying to outwit your opponent in this classic game of Connect-4!
